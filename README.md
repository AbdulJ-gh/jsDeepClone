# jsDeepClone
Recursive deep cloning of object and arrays in JavaScript

Is meant to deep clone data structres, will not work with objects containing other than:
+ Primitives (Number, String, Boolean, undefined, null)
+ Objects (including Arrays)

This means it will not work for objects containing functions (at the moment)
